Lychee is a free photo-management tool, which runs on your server or web-space. Installing is a matter of seconds. Upload, manage and share photos like from a native application. Lychee comes with everything you need and all your photos are stored securely. Try the [Live Demo](http://ld.electerious.com) or read more on our [Website](http://lychee.electerious.com).

## Installation

To run Lychee, everything you need is a web-server with PHP 5.5 or later and a MySQL-Database. Follow the instructions to install Lychee on your server. [Installation &#187;](docs/Installation.md)

## How to use

You can use Lychee right after the installation. Here are some advanced features to get the most out of it.

### Settings

Sign in and click the gear on the top left corner to change your settings. If you want to edit them manually: MySQL details are stored in `data/config.php`. Other options and hidden settings are stored directly in the database. [Settings &#187;](docs/Settings.md)

### Update

Updating is as easy as it should be.  [Update &#187;](docs/Update.md)

### Build

Lychee is ready to use, right out of the box. If you want to contribute and edit CSS or JS files, you need to rebuild Lychee. [Build &#187;](docs/Build.md)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

These shortcuts will help you to use Lychee even faster. [Keyboard Shortcuts &#187;](docs/Keyboard Shortcuts.md)

### Dropbox import

In order to use the Dropbox import from your server, you need a valid drop-ins app key from [their website](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create). Lychee will ask you for this key, the first time you try to use the import. Want to change your code? Take a look at [the settings](docs/Settings.md) of Lychee.

### Twitter Cards

Lychee supports [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) and [Open Graph](http://opengraphprotocol.org) for shared images ([not albums](https://github.com/electerious/Lychee/issues/384)). In order to use Twitter Cards you need to request an approval for your domain. Simply share an image with Lychee, copy its link and paste it in [Twitters Card Validator](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator).

### Imagick

Lychee uses [Imagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) when installed on your server. In this case you will benefit from a faster processing of your uploads, better looking thumbnails and intermediate sized images for small screen devices. You can disable the usage of [Imagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) in [the settings](docs/Settings.md).

### Docker

Browse the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/kdelfour/lychee-docker/) for various automated Lychee-Docker builds. We recommed to use [lychee-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/kdelfour/lychee-docker/) by [kdelfour](https://github.com/kdelfour).

### Plugins and Extensions

The plugin-system of Lychee allows you to execute scripts, when a certain action fires. Plugins are hooks, which are injected directly into Lychee. [Plugin documentation &#187;](docs/Plugins.md)

It's also possible to build extensions upon Lychee. The way to do so isn't documented and can change every time. We recommend to use the plugin-system, when possible.
