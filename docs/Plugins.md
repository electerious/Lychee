### About

The plugin-system of Lychee allows you to execute scripts, when a certain action fires. Plugins are hooks, which are injected directly into Lychee. They only affect the back-end and can't modify the front-end.

### Use Cases

* Automatically watermark photos on upload
* Automatically set albums public
* Write metadata changes back to the original photo
* â€¦

### How to create a plugin

1. Create a folder in `plugins/`
2. Create an `index.php` within the new folder and with the following content:

```php
<?php

###
# @name			ExamplePlugin
# @author		Tobias Reich
# @copyright	2015 by Tobias Reich
###

if (!defined('LYCHEE')) exit('Error: Direct access is not allowed!');

class ExamplePlugin implements SplObserver {

	private $database = null;
	private $settings = null;

	public function __construct($database, $settings) {

		# These params are passed to your plugin from Lychee
		# Save them to access the database and settings of Lychee
		$this->database = $database;
		$this->settings = $settings;

		# Add more code here if wanted
		# __construct() will be called every time Lychee gets called
		# Make sure this part is performant

		return true;

	}

	public function update(\SplSubject $subject) {

		# Check if the called hook is the hook you are waiting for
		# A list of all hooks is available online
		if ($subject->action!=='Photo::add:before') return false;

		# Do something when Photo::add:before gets called
		# $this->database => The database of Lychee
		# $this->settings => The settings of Lychee
		# $subject->args => Params passed to the original function

		return true;

	}

}

# Register your plugin
$plugins->attach(new ExamplePlugin($database, $settings));
```

3. Add the plugin-path to the database of Lychee

Select the table `lychee_settings` and edit the value of `plugins` to the path of your plugin. The path must be relative from the `plugins/`-folder: `ExamplePlugin/index.php`.

Divide multiple plugins with semicolons: `Plugin01/index.php;Plugin02/index.php`.

### Available hooks

##### About :before and :after
Hooks named `:before` will be executed prior to the original function.
Hooks named `:after` will be executed after the original function.

`Album::add:before` will be called when the user creates a new album in Lychee. The album doesn't exist at this moment.
