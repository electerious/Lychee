### 1. Requirements
Everything you need is a web-server with PHP 5.5 or later and a MySQL-Database.

The following PHP extensions must be activated:

	session, exif, mbstring, gd, mysqli, json, zip
	
To use Lychee without restrictions, we recommend to increase the values of the following properties in `php.ini`:

	max_execution_time = 200
	post_max_size = 100M
	upload_max_size = 100M
	upload_max_filesize = 20M
	memory_limit = 256M
