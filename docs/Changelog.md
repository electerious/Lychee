## v3.1.0

Released March 29, 2016

**Warning**: It's no longer possible to update from Lychee versions older than 2.7.

**Warning**: Plugins which use the plugin API of Lychee must be updated to work with the new back-end.

**Notice**: It's no longer possible to edit the thumb quality in the database.

**Notice**: It's no longer possible to disable the creation of medium-sized photos when Imagick is installed on the system.

This updates includes a huge rewrite of the back-end. We are now using namespaces and the singleton pattern for Settings::get(), Database::get() and Plugins::get(). Everything is way better documented thanks to PHPDoc comments. Ugly `#` comments have been replaced with the more known `//`. Unused functions are gone and returns are more strict. We also added a handy module to output messages. Failed database updates and invalid queries will be saved to the log.
